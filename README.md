# Barrel

Generate barrel files for each folder for Dart and Flutter projects. A barrel file is a file that exports all the files in a directory. This is useful when you have a lot of files in a directory and you want to import them all in one go.

## Getting Started

Add the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  barrel_annotation: ^1.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.13
  barrel_generator: ^1.0.4
```

Decorate one of your files placed in the source root of your project with the `BarrelConfig` annotation:

```dart
import 'package:barrel_annotation/barrel_annotation.dart';

@BarrelConfig(exclude: [
  'lib/lib.barrel.dart',
])
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

Run the following command to generate the barrel files:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Features

- [x] Generate barrel files for each folder
- [x] Exclude files and directories
- [x] Generate barrel files for Flutter projects
- [x] Generate barrel files for Dart projects
- [x] Generate barrel files for packages

## Configuration

The `BarrelConfig` annotation has the following properties:

- `exclude`: A list of files and directories to exclude from the barrel file.

## Example

Given the following directory structure:

```
lib/
  excluded/
    f.dart
    g.dart
  folder/
    subfolder/
    a.dart
    b.dart
    c.dart
  example.dart
```

With the following configuration:

```dart
import 'package:barrel_annotation/barrel_annotation.dart';

@BarrelConfig(exclude: [
  'lib/lib.barrel.dart',
  'lib/excluded/**',
])
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

The generated barrel files structure will look like this:
```
lib/
  excluded/
    f.dart
    g.dart
  folder/
    subfolder/
    a.dart
    b.dart
    c.dart
    folder.barrel.dart
  example.dart
```

The content of `lib/folder/folder.barrel.dart` will be:
```dart
// This file is generated by barrel_generator

// Barrel files
export 'subfolder/subfolder.barrel.dart';
// Other files
export 'c.dart';
export 'a.dart';
export 'b.dart';
```
